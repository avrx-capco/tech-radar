            React

           is the world’s most popular JavaScript library that uses components to change content of a single-page Mobile and Web application without refreshing.

            Managing states is one of the biggest challenges in large web applications. Using React alone may not be sufficient to handle such complexity. We need a way to share data across components by creating a central store that holds all states of your application.

            The point of building a frontend User Interface with React is how flexible it can be, especially when it comes to building separate components. It is important to know that whatever styling strategy you may decide to use, you are still writing CSS. The difference is that the strategies together with the library make the process easier because of the uniqueness of React.

            The first purpose of testing is to prevent bugs from releasing to production. Testing ensures the features are functioning correctly for complex components and modular applications and is required for the effective performance of a software application or product making it more robust and less prone to error.
