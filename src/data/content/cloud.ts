    intro:
      "In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services - now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. <br/><br/>Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

Whether you need to deploy your application workloads across the globe in a single click, or you want to build and deploy specific applications closer to your end-users with single-digit millisecond latency, AWS provides you the cloud infrastructure where and when you need it. <img width='100%' src='https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/03/17/aws_regions-1.png'/>AWS data centres are physical facilities designed to meet specific requirements of resiliency, redundancy as well as conform to regional data residency requirements within a specified geography. Key to this is the concept of Availability zones. <br/> <br/>Availability zones are distinct separate facilities within a region. AWS availability zones enable replication of applications and data to protect against single points of failure. This allows the design of high availability and redundancy in your applications. <br/><br/>Today the AWS Cloud spans 81 Availability Zones within 25 geographic regions around the world, with announced plans for 21 more Availability Zones and 7 more AWS Regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Israel, Spain, Switzerland, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). <img width='100%' src='https://digitalcloud.training/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aws-global-infrastructure.png'/>With millions of active customers and tens of thousands of partners globally, AWS has the largest and most dynamic ecosystem.

You can set up your code to automatically trigger from over 200 AWS services and SaaS applications or call it directly from any web or mobile app. You can write Lambda functions in your favourite language (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more) and use both serverless and container tools, such as AWS SAM or Docker CLI, to build, test, and deploy your functions.
